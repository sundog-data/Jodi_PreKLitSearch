Abstract: 
We use admissions lotteries to estimate the effects of large-scale public preschool in Boston on  
college-going, college preparation, standardized test scores, and behavioral outcomes. Preschool  enrollment boosts college attendance, as well as SAT test-taking and high school graduation. 

Preschool also decreases several disciplinary measures including juvenile incarceration, but has  
no detectable impact on state achievement test scores. An analysis of subgroups shows that  
effects on college enrollment, SAT-taking, and disciplinary outcomes are larger for boys than for  
girls. Our findings illustrate possibilities for large-scale modern, public preschool and highlight  
the importance of measuring long-term and non-test score outcomes in evaluating the  
effectiveness of education programs

Take Aways: 

P. 12: "A preschool offer increases on-time college enrollment by 5.4 percentage points.... This estimate, which is statistically significant
at the 1% level, implies an 18% increase in on-time college enrollment relative to the 46% rate for
non-offered students (column (1))."

P. 15: "Enrollment in a BPS preschool increases the probability that students graduate from a Massachusetts public high school on time by 5.4 percentage points (p < 0.1), and this effect grows to 6.0 percentage points when we include students who graduate at any time (p < 0.05). The estimated effect on ever graduating high school is a 9% increase relative to the non-offered graduation rate of 64%"

P.18: "Table 7 displays 2SLS estimates of the effects of preschool attendance on several disciplinary outcomes measured in high school. Preschool attendance reduces the total number of suspensions students receive in high school by 0.24 (p < 0.1)."

P.21: "The results of our analysis show that public preschool enrollment boosts post-secondary and
college preparatory outcomes. Students randomly assigned to attend a Boston preschool experience
fewer disciplinary incidents in high school, take the SAT and graduate high school at higher rates,
and are more likely to enroll in college."

Important Paragraphs:

Preschool is critical to ensuring that children start kindergarten with the skills and supports that set them up for success in school. In fact, [research shows](https://www.future-ed.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Gormley_et_al-2017-Journal_of_Policy_Analysis_and_Management.pdf) that kids who attend universal pre-K are more likely to take honors classes and less likely to repeat a grade, and [another study](https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/the-impacts-of-expanding-access-to-high-quality-preschool-education/) finds low-income children who attend universal programs do better in math and reading as late as eighth grade. Unfortunately, many children, but especially children of color and low-income children, [do not have access to](https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/edtrustmain/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/05162154/Young-Learners-Missed-Opportunities.pdf) the full range of high-quality pre-school programs available to their more affluent peers. In addition to providing critical benefits for children, preschool has also been shown to [increase labor force participation](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2018/09/26/458208/effects-universal-preschool-washington-d-c/) among parents – especially women — boosting family earnings and driving economic growth.  By some estimates, the benefits of a universal pre-K system to U.S. GDP are [more than three times greater than the investment](https://equitablegrowth.org/research-paper/public-investments-in-education-can-spur-equitable-growth-pay-for-themselves-and-create-jobs-for-a-stronger-economic-recovery/?longform=true) needed to provide this service.

   **President Biden is calling for a national partnership with states to offer free, high-quality, accessible, and inclusive preschool to all three-and four-year-olds, benefitting five million children and saving the average family $13,000,** when fully implemented**.** This historic $200 billion investment in America’s future will first prioritize high-need areas and enable communities and families to choose the settings that work best for them. The President’s plan will also ensure that all publicly-funded preschool is high-quality, with low student-to-teacher ratios, high-quality and developmentally appropriate curriculum, and supportive classroom environments that are inclusive for all students. The President’s plan will leverage investments in tuition-free community college and teacher scholarships to support those who wish to earn a bachelor’s degree or another credential that supports their work as an educator, or to become an early childhood educator. And, educators will receive job-embedded coaching, professional development, and wages that reflect the importance of their work. All employees in participating pre-K programs and Head Start will earn at least $15 per hour, and those with comparable qualifications will receive compensation commensurate with that of kindergarten teachers. These investments will give American children a head start and pave the way for the best-educated generation in U.S. history.


3) The effect of Tulsa's Pre-K Program on Middle School Performance

Abstract: 
As states have upgraded their commitment to pre-K education over the past two  
decades, questions have arisen. Critics argue that program effects are likely to fade  
out or disappear over time, while supporters contend that program effects are likely to  
persist under certain conditions. Using data from Tulsa Public Schools, three neigh-  
boring school districts, and the state of Oklahoma, and propensity score weighting,  
we estimate the effects of Tulsa’s universal, school-based pre-K program on multiple  
measures of academic progress for middle school students. We find enduring effects on  
math achievement test scores, enrollment in honors courses, and grade retention for  
students as a whole, and similar effects for certain subgroups. We conclude that some  
positive effects of a high-quality pre-K program are discernible as late as middle school.

Key Takeaways: 

"A $30 billion annual public investment in high-quality pre-K schooling over  
35 years causes an increase in present-value Gross Domestic Product that  
outstrips the cost of the investment by $3.08 for every dollar invested and  
creates 353,000 jobs within 2 years. The present-value budgetary savings  
from increased tax revenues and expenditure savings surpass the cost of the  
program by a ratio of 1.61-to-1. This means that the investment more than  
pays for itself both in the form of greater GDP and budgetary savings." ( Page 4)
